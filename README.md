# Color-Detection

## * **Color Detection in Real-time using Python-Opencv**
This project can automatically get the name of the color by taking the object to the center of the webcam.


## * **Color Detection using Deep Learning (ResNet500)**
ResNet-50 is CNN architecture that belongs to the ResNet (Residual Networks) family, a series of models designed to address the challenges associated with training deep neural networks. 


## Dataset üìä
These datasets include:
the most diverse and large-scale Vehicle Color Recognition (VCoR) dataset with 15 colors classes 

Image Acquisition
Images in this dataset were sourced from google. The were further cleaned up, post-processed, annotated and consolidated into a dataset. VCoR is a large scale and most diverse Vehicle color recognition dataset. VCoR contains 10k+ image samples and 15 color classes which is almost twice as diverse as the largest existing dataset. The 15 color categories represent the most popular vehicle color models according to CarMax, including: white, black, grey, silver, red, blue, brown, green, beige, orange, gold, yellow, purple, pink, and tan.

Content
There is one main zip file available for download which contains 3 sub-folders.
1) train folder contains 15 folders for all 15 color classes, and about 7.5K images
2) val folder contains 15 folders for all 15 color classes, and about 1.5K images
3) test folder contains 15 folders for all 15 color classes, and about 1.5K images
